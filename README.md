# Visualize COVID-19 vaccination stance in relation with (de)motivating topics

Vaccine hesitancy is one of the significant obstacles to eradicating the COVID-19 and putting humanity back on track. In my thesis I analyzed the (de)motivating topics and its relation with public stance towards COVID-19 vaccine. This visualization approach may help us understand the relation between resonating topics on social media that are (de)motivating the public and help the healthcare workers to address them accordingly.
